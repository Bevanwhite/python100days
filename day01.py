# print() funtion - inside the quotes only in printing
# print("Hello world")


# Example 01 Output
# After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:
# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')

# print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
# print("The function is declared like this:")
# print("print('what to print')")

# using \n 
# print("Hello world!\nHello world!\nHello world!")

# combining strings
# print("Hello" + " " + "Beva")
# print("Hello " + "Beva")
# print("Hello" + " Beva")

# Example 02 Output
# Day 1 - String Manipulation
# String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
# New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

# print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
# print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# input function
# input("what is your Name?")

# exercise 03
# get the number of letter's in the input string
# name = input("what is your name? ")
# print(len(name))

# alternative solution - one line code
# print(len(input("what is your name?")))
